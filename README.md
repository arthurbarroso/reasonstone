# Reasonstone

## About:
Reasonstone is a reason-relay powered infinite scroll Hearthstone cards browser.


## Initial setup:
Reasonstone should be used with [hearthstone-cards-relay-api](https://github.com/arthurbarroso/hearthstone-cards-relay-api). With your server up and running you'll simply need to install the application's dependencies with `yarn`.

## Running it:
After setting everything up you should be able to start buckescript using `yarn start` and run webpack with `yarn webpack:server`. Doing so will export Reasonstone into port 8000.
